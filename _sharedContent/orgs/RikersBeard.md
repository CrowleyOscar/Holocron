Riker’s Beard is a small business with only a few staff members. The boss - Richard - manages the staff and the overall business. There are two main sales people - Jeff and Milo - who are full time employees and deal with the customers and make sales. They also order products from their suppliers, which could be specific orders as well as the new releases. There are multiple part-time staff, who perform the similar roles to Jeff and Milo, without ordering products. Because Richard refuses to do any accounting of any sort, he hires Ryan from Rehtac & Associates to perform all the accounting for the business.

Richard works on future business, including writing proposals, marketing, and organising sponsorships for comic conventions to ensure the business will continue smoothly in the future. Jeff, Milo and the part time sales staff sell products to customers, but also are a point of knowledge for customer inquiries. They also take specific orders from customers - e.g. a customer wishes to purchase a graphic novel which needs to be ordered from the supplier. Ryan gets information from Richard regarding the business plans but also from Jeff who supplies the monthly sales figures. This allows Ryan to give Richard an accurate report indicating the amount of money the business has.

Riker’s Beard imports comics and other comic related products from suppliers, mainly from America, but some from Australia. These include the latest comic releases, which are released each Wednesday, or specific orders from customers. The release schedule for new releases are published in the “Previews” magazine months in advance. Customers are also able to create “standing orders” so that they don’t need to specifically order a particular issue, they just order the series and each issue is placed aside for them. Currently this is done with a book listing the customer names and which titles they wish to order and the comics are put aside for them. There have been instances where some issues have been missed when the sales staff have been busy when the weekly shipment has come in.

Orders from suppliers are registered in the Orders Ledger, which lists specific items and which issue the item is, if necessary. This book is already quite cumbersome after the company has only been operating for 4 months.Sales are made through the cash register, but in order for Ryan to perform her job properly as well as keep track of stock levels, the staff are also required to write down in the Sales Ledger each item that is sold, including specific information such as the issue number.

At the end of each month, Jeff and Milo must tally up the sales from the Sales Ledger. They must also perform an inventory which involves checking the Sales Ledger and comparing it to the Order Ledger. From there, they can quantify the stock they have in the store. Each month, they write a report and email it to Richard to keep him up-to-date with how the store is going.

As the company is newly operating, Richard wishes to make sure the company is competitive. He has asked Jeff and Milo to keep track of the other comic book stores in Canberra, and elsewhere in Australia, to see the prices they are selling their products at. Especially with the volatile nature of the Australian Dollar.
